# Lean MEAN app with a heatmap
(formerly known as heroku/node-js-getting-started)

Project "voor m'n doelstellingen" that aims to be a full-stack JS app. Originally intended to use the 'official' [MEAN](http://mean.io) stack, but since that was too restricted/opinionated for my taste it uses no app framework instead, yay!

## M.E.A.N.
- **M**ongoDB (MongoLab Heroku plugin)
- **E**xpress (Express 4 REST framework)
- ~~**A**ngularJS~~ Nope, extra emphasis on vanilla JS
- **N**ode (superfluous, but calling it the MEA stack would have been lame)

## Features
- Deployed to and run from Heroku
- Express 4 app on the server
- Serves a static page
